Face Recognition using TensorFlow and LFW Dataset
This project demonstrates a face recognition system using TensorFlow and the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset. The system trains a convolutional neural network (CNN) to recognize faces from the LFW dataset and can identify individuals in new images.

Installation
Clone the repository:

sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Dhaarini24/face-recognition-using-TensorFlow.git
cd face-recognition-tf
Install required packages:

Make sure you have Python 3.6 or later. Install the required Python packages using pip:

Dataset
The LFW dataset is a public benchmark for face recognition algorithms. This script downloads the dataset automatically.

Usage
Download and prepare the dataset:

The dataset will be downloaded and extracted automatically when you run the script.

Run the script:

The script loads the dataset, preprocesses it, builds the CNN model, trains it on the LFW dataset, and evaluates its performance. It also saves the trained model to a file named face_recognition_model.h5.

Recognize a face:

Use the saved model to recognize faces in new images by providing the path to the image you want to test.

Results
After training, the model's accuracy on the test set will be displayed. The saved model can be used to recognize faces in new images.
